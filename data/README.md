## Other sources

[Dmonte et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.14317) list 31 English-langauge datasets used for automated claim-verification systems. The median number of instances is 12500, with an IQR of 1751 to 23662. With the possible exceptions of **SciFact** (listed above) and **SciFact-Open**, these datasets do not address quotation accuracy in peer-reviewed scientific publications and will not be used in this project.
