{"id": 47, "claim": "Despite the fact that mitochondrial dysfunction has long been considered a metabolic hallmark of cancer cells, studies have also indicated that tumor cells not only have functional mitochondria but also that their activity is essential for tumorigenesis. By regulating the generation of ROS, ATP and other metabolites driving bioenergetic and biosynthetic processes, mitochondria have a key role in cancer progression. Oncogenic activation of MYC and KRAS promote increased glucose utilization and addiction in different types of tumors, while also enhancing the mitochondrial-dependent biosynthesis of macromolecules through increased ATP levels and TCA cycle intermediates. To replenish the TCA cycle substrates and fuel their uncontrolled growth, cancer cells utilize specific mechanisms of anaplerosis on the basis of the oxidation of glutamine to α-ketoglutarate and its conversion to oxaloacetate. As a consequence of oxidative metabolism, physiological amounts of ROS are produced at the level of the mETC, inducing the pro-tumoral activation of redox-sensitive pathways. To prevent ROS-induced toxicity, cancer cells redirect the metabolic intermediates coming from glutamine and one-carbon metabolism into alternative pathways that generate NADPH and GSH, antioxidants molecules readily used by several ROS-scavenging enzymes. Interestingly, tumors with impaired TCA cycle activity (or mutations in the mETC complexes) and that rely on glycolysis for ATP synthesis, shift to reductive glutaminolysis to mediate biosynthetic processes and cell survival. Such tumor cells depend on mitochondrial-derived ROS to promote cell proliferation and metastasis formation. In contrast to what is generally assumed, many tumors still use mitochondria for ATP production, despite the Warburg effect should provide sufficient amounts of ATP for their biological needs. Indeed, poorly vascularized and other subsets of tumors growing under limited glucose conditions heavily rely on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP synthesis, a weakness that might be targeted with drugs that limit glucose utilization and block mitochondrial bioenergetics. With this respect, two anti-diabetic biguanides, such as metformin and phenformin, show promising antitumoral effects. Epidemiological studies have shown that metformin decreases the incidence of cancer and prolongs the survival rate of patients with solid tumors. More studies have reported also that the in vivo antitumorigenic effects of metformin depended on the inhibition of the mETC complex-I activity and the decrease of circulating glucose and insulin levels. Metformin was also able to impair the growth of NSCLCs by blocking the activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and by potentiating the pro-apoptotic efficacy of ionizing radiation. Also, metformin selectively killed breast cancer stem cells through profound depletion of triphosphate nucleotides presumably reflecting a major impairment of the energetic metabolism. Therefore, another biguanide, called phenformin, has emerged as a potential anticancer agent due to its liposolubility, higher affinity for mETC complex-I and stronger antineoplastic activity. Phenformin enhanced the efficacy of the BRAF inhibitor PLX4270 both in vitro and in genetic models of melanoma driven by BRAFV600E mutations triggering apoptotic cell death upon inhibition of the mTOR pathway. Phenformin also induced selective apoptosis in a subset of NSCLCs with loss of the tumor suppressor LKB1 and oncogenic mutations in K-ras lowering the ATP levels and eliciting the activation of caspase 3. Despite the encouraging results, it should also be mentioned that the use of phenformin has been associated with lactic acidosis, an important pitfall that might limit its clinical applicability. For this reason, novel compounds that target the mETC complex-I (i.e., VLX600) or alternative strategies based on the translation of specific mitochondrial proteins (i.e., tigecycline) have been designed and currently successfully employed in preclinical studies. Although the potential utility of these compounds still needs to be validated in long-term clinical trials, encouraging evidences suggest that targeting the bioenergetics function of the mitochondria might represent a valid therapeutic option for cancer treatment.", "evidence": {"52022": [{"sentences": [0], "label": "SUPPORT"}]}, "cited_doc_ids": [52022]}

HOTAIR recruits PRC2 and lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) protein complexes to the HOXD gene cluster and changes its histone methylation status and chromatin configuration. Thereby, it causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes. It has been implicated in breast, colorectal, gastrointestinal, and pancreatic cancers apart from HCC.

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages are then activated by targeting a set of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). PRRs then activate the inflammatory signaling pathway, triggering a wave of local inflammation and a robust secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6 and IFNγ.
